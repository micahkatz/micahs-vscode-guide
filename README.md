My guide on maximizing efficiency with my favorite code editor â€“  VSCode

### Finding the Right Theme
I personally use the [**Palenight Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme)
- Change the theme and browse themes by opening the command pallette (Command + Shift + P) and typing `Preferences: Color Theme`

### Extensions!!!
I use a lot of extensions. I currently have 91 installed, but I will go over some of my favorites and rank them in this guide.

1. [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag. This is particularlly useful for my React projects.
2. [Camel Case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarioQueiros.CamelCase) Will Transform selected text in camel case notation. Very useful when having a lot of cursors at the same time
3. [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) This is great for spell checking variable names and comments. It will even be able to spellcheck camelCase.
4. [Color Picker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anseki.vscode-color&ssr=false#review-details) This is great to see the color of a hex value and change it easily.

5. [DotEnv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv) This is great for handling .env files and coloring them correctly
